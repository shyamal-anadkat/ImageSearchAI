Christmas Image Search 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Implemented in Java, using Amazon ElasticSearch 5.1 for image-search.
+ Used the Predict API of Clarifai for tagging the images. 
+ URLs to images are in data.txt (feel free to add more images).
+ The system can run locally as follows:
- run the elastic search server locally on default port 
- run App.java with -Dlog4j.configurationFile=/christmas/src/main/resources/log4j2.properties
- Under the UI folder open index.html and execute queries. 
You should be able to see the image URLs in the results if the queries are success.
The UI templates are used from an open-source project.
